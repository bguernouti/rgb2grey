# rgb2grey
This is simple and quick project based on ```pypng```, it allow to convert colored **".png"** images (rgb or rgba) to grayscale **."png"** (black and white).

The `core/converter.py` is the main file, reading it is not too much difficult :relaxed: :relaxed:

# Install requirements
`pip install requirements.txt`
# Images locations
Every **.png** file must placed in `images/colored` directory

# Use cases
1. Convert every **.png** files located in `images/colored` dir: 
   - ### `python png2gery.py -a`

2. Convert single file (also must be located in `images/colored`):

   - ### `python png2gery.py -f img_name`
   ***note*** : providing ".png" with file name is not mandatory.

That's all. :wink: :wink:
